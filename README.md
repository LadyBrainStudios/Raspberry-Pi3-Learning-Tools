Suggestions from Oguz Yetkin:
All the "text files" from 1990s BBS systems (accuracy not guaranteed), Python, gcc, java, PERL, all the UNIX man pages, netcat, Processing, Arduino, PDFs of: "Unix in a Nutshell", the "Head First" series of books for programming languages of your choice, Make Magazine issues, the top 1000 articles from Wikipedia, the top 1000 books from Project Gutenberg, the top 100 projects from Instructables (wget is your friend) and all the scientific articles I've been stockpiling in my "interesting_papers" folder) If there is room, you might want to get mp3s of your favorite podcasts (I'd do "Science News Update" from JJ Campanella and maybe Starship Sofa and Escape Pod for entertainment).
